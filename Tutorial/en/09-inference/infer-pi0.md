# Inference Command Line - pi0

## Ubuntu

- Delete the existing eval-prefixed dataset (if any)

```Shell
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM*
sudo rm -rf /home/tommy/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/Tommymy/eval_lerobot_my_dataset_shake_hands
export TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false
```

- Inference command line

```Shell
lerobot-record  \
  --robot.type=so101_follower \
  --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM0 \
  --robot.cameras="{ front: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 0, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 60, fourcc: "MJPG"}}" \
  --robot.id=my_follower_arm \
  --display_data=false \
  --dataset.repo_id=Tommymy/eval_lerobot_my_dataset_shake_hands \
  --dataset.single_task="Shake Hands" \
  --dataset.episode_time_s=1000 \
  --dataset.push_to_hub=false \
  --policy.path=/home/tommy/Downloads/lerobot_output/shake/pi0/50K/pretrained_model

## Why Inference on a Mac Makes the Arm Stutter

- The dataset is too small
- The GPU doesn't have enough memory; you need a 50-series card
