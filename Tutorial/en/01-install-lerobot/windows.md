![This image is the Miniconda3 installation screen on Windows, showing software version py312_24.7.1-0 (64-bit). The screen offers two installation type options, in which the option labeled "Just Me (recommended)" is highlighted with a red box and is the currently selected recommended installation method, while the other option, "All Users (requires admin privileges)", is not selected. The top of the screen prompts you to choose an install type for Miniconda3, and the bottom has three buttons: "Back", "Next" and "Cancel". This screen is the key step in the Miniconda installation flow for confirming the installation scope.](../../en/images/d16-01.png)

## Change the conda Mirror

```Shell
# First clear the existing mirror configuration (to avoid conflicts)
conda config --remove-key channels

# Replace conda's default channels and common third-party channels with the Tsinghua mirror
# Add the default package channels (main/r/msys2)
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/main/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/r/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/msys2/

# Add common third-party channels
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/conda-forge/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/msys2/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/bioconda/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/menpo/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/pytorch/

# Turn on showing the download source, so the exact download address is displayed when installing packages
conda config --set show_channel_urls yes

# Clear the index cache so the new mirrors take effect
conda clean -i

# View the current configuration (to verify that the channels were added successfully)
conda config --show-sources
```

## Create a Virtual Environment

```Shell
conda create -y -n lerobot python=3.12
```

## Activate the Virtual Environment

```Shell
conda activate lerobot
```

## Install ffmpeg

```Shell
conda install ffmpeg=7.1.1 -c conda-forge -y
```

Verify that the installation succeeded

```Shell
ffmpeg
```

![This image is the Windows command line window, showing the verification result after running the ffmpeg command. Specifically, the command line outputs ffmpeg version 7.1.1, with copyright and build information, along with information about ffmpeg's associated library files, and usage notes at the bottom covering basic usage and how to get more help. This image is used to verify that ffmpeg was installed successfully on a Windows computer, corresponding to the verification step after "Install ffmpeg", and visually presenting the running state once ffmpeg installation is complete.](../../en/images/d16-03.png)

## Download LeRobot

- Download the official LeRobot repository

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
```

## Install the Code Repository

```Shell
cd lerobot
```

```Plain Text
pip install -e ".[feetech]"
```

![The image shows the verification result in the Windows cmd command line after installing the LeRobot code repository. The command line displays messages such as "Successfully built lerobot", indicating the installation succeeded. It also lists several Python packages and their version numbers, such as numpy 1.22.3 and scipy 1.7.1. The bottom shows the prompt "(lerobot) C:\\Users\\40743\\Downloads\\lerobot>", indicating the current directory is the lerobot folder under Downloads. This image corresponds to the "Verify the Installation" section, visually presenting the command line feedback after a successful installation.](../../en/images/d16-06.png)

## Verify the Installation

```Shell
python

import lerobot
import scservo_sdk
import torch
torch.cuda.is_available()
```

![The image shows the screen verifying a successful installation in the Python environment on Windows. The command line displays Python version 3.10.19, ran code importing modules such as lerobot, scservo_sdk and torch, and finally executed torch.cuda.is_available(), which returned False. This image corresponds to the "Verify the Installation" section, visually presenting the operation and result of verifying a successful installation through the Python environment after installing the LeRobot code repository.](../../en/images/d16-07.png)
